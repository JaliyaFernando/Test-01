## AN INNOVATIVE E – LEARNING APPLICATION FOR STUDENTS AND LECTURERS

Failure at exams and improve in pass rates is a current topic among educationalist and policy makers. Irony is that some students fail even after spending a lot of time in classroom studies and individual preparations. Lessons for this outcome would be manifold. These include poor absorption of study content in terms of volume and speed, poor study techniques because of mainly being engrossed in traditional techniques and lack of imagination to capture important elements. From our perspective as students “studying made easier” will remain a research forever. As we see delivering subject content, studying, providing study materials, examination techniques, marking and evaluation criteria etc. have gone through inexplicable criteria over the years. Scarcity of time has made studying and exams more challenging making it necessary to
“study on the go”.

## Main Objective
Improve the efficiency of students studying abilities and their performance when studying which will eventually lead to better performance better at exams. In simple terms our main goal is to make studying easier with the concept of survey, questions and review.

	- How to help students to keep their minds  away from distractions while studying.
